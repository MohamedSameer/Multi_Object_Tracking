# Multi-Object Tracking

To track multiple vehicles, we utilize the appearance and motion features of the target vehicles in consecutive frames. The proposed multi-vehicle tracking system employs a deep convolutional neural network, which is trained with a triplet loss minimization method to extract appearance features. The key contribution of the proposed method lies in a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a fully connected layer that accurately predicts the probability distribution of the next appearance and motion features of tracked objects.

# Another Film samples uploaded to my YouTube channel

Due to the limitation of file size uploaded to GitHub repository (25 MB), we uploaded the video samples to a YouTube channel.

We uploaded a few film samples that show how our old version system that can track vehicles (Cars, Trucks, Buses) only, behaves when tracking vehicles in the presence of these other objects like (pedestrians, motorcycle, and bicycles).

Also, we uploaded a few film samples that show the tracking behavior of our system including other types of objects (pedestrians, motorcycle, and bicycles)
