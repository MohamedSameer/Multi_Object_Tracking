# Multi_Object_Tracking

To track multiple vehicles, we utilize the appearance and motion features of the target vehicles in consecutive frames. The proposed multi-vehicle tracking system employs a deep convolutional neural network, which is trained with a triplet loss minimization method to extract appearance features. The key contribution of the proposed method lies in a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a fully connected layer that accurately predicts the probability distribution of the next appearance and motion features of tracked objects.
